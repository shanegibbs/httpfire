## Development

Requires:
- `go >= 1.17.6`
- `make`
- `docker`
- `docker-compose`

Run in local mode for development

```shell
$ make local
```

## Docker

Build and run a local cluster with docker compose

```shell
$ make up
```

Start a test plan

Cleanup (remove docker containers etc)

## Notes

Problem

- Agents can overwhelm the OS and be unable to open or accept new connections.
- This breaks communication between the agent and any other service, including the director and prometheus.

Solution

- Agents connect back to director and maintain connection on a "command channel"
- Agents send stats to director
- Agents exit if connection is broken
